          <p>
            We are a group of people with decades of experience in growing and
            selling oranges. We know what a good orange looks like and how they
            are grown. This essential fruit requires a temperate climate, loamy
            soil that is rich in organic matter apart from needing proper
            drainage and aeration facilities. Lucky for us we live in Nagpur
            which is proudly known as paradise of earth is also home to
            temperate fruits like orange for which the state is very famous
            across globe. The main factor which influence temperate fruit
            bearing trees is soil, climate and environment which are highly
            favorable and unparalleled in the province of Nagpur. Nagpur
            oranges a unique look, taste, flavor, size and color.
